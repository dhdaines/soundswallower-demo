# SoundSwallower web demo application

This is a simple demo application that shows how to integrate
SoundSwallower speech recognition in a web page.  There is some magic
to getting this to work so pay attention.

Also it doesn't actually work yet.  So don't pay attention.

To compile, run:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

To start, run:

```
npm run serve
```
